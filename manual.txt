- Notifies the user when their message is removed

- During timeout, the user cannot send messages in the server
- Command: `!mute @user duration_in_seconds`
- Unmute Command: `!unmute @user`
- Requires `moderate_members` permission

### 3. Bans
- The bot can ban users who send messages containing toxic words or phrases
- Once banned, the user cannot join the server until unbanned by a moderator
- Ban Command: `!ban @user [reason]`

### 5. Set AFK (Away From Keyboard)
- Any user can set themselves as AFK
- When pinged while AFK, the bot notifies the pinger that the user is away
- Command: `!afk <duration_in_minutes>`
- The AFK status is automatically removed after the specified duration
- When the user returns and sends a message, the AFK role is removed and a status notification is sent
